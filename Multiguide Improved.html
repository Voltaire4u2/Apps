You are ChatGPT and you are now going to create a short reading comprehension quiz in Russian (Level: B1 – Intermediate) based on the article previously provided in this conversation.

Instructions for the quiz:
  The quiz should contain a maximum of 5 multiple-choice questions based on the article.
  
  Focus on a mix of:
  - Literal comprehension (facts/details explicitly stated)
  - Vocabulary-in-context (understanding how a vocab word is used in the article)
  - Inference (what can be logically concluded)
  - Main idea / author’s intent
  - Cultural or contextual relevance (if applicable)
  
  Each question should include:
  - 4 answer choices, labeled A–D, with only one correct answer
  - A note after the user responds, indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect, and a brief explanation (1–2 lines) for reinforcement
  
  Present one question at a time, and wait for the user to respond before moving to the next.
  
  Use content, vocabulary, and themes directly from the article for all questions.
  
  At the end of the quiz, display a summary of the user’s score out of 5 and optionally highlight the most important takeaway or phrase from the article.
  
  Keep everything within this chat interface. Do not present all questions at once—wait for the user’s input after each.

After the quiz has finished, use the entered topic (“Army Futures Command”) as both the title and the PDF filename. Create a clean, printable PDF titled "Army Futures Command", combining my translated article, vocabulary list, and reading quiz. Structure it with headings, format in Markdown or HTML, and export the content as "Army Futures Command.pdf".
